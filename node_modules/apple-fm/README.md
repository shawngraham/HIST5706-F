# apple-fm

**Apple Intelligence from your command line and your code.** apple-fm gives you
the on-device **Foundation Models** on **macOS 26+ / Apple Silicon** — free,
private, and fully offline. No API key, no cloud, no network — your prompts never
leave your Mac.

Apple ships these models as a Swift-only framework with no command-line
front-end. apple-fm provides one — a fast, lightweight CLI and a TypeScript
library, so you can use the on-device model from your terminal or your code.

## Why apple-fm

- **On-device & private.** Runs on the model Apple Intelligence already
  installed. No key, no cloud, no telemetry — your prompts never leave the
  machine.
- **One binary, three shapes.** `probe`, one-shot `generate` (freeform, guided,
  or streamed), and an interactive `chat` — all over a single
  [NDJSON protocol](docs/4-protocol.md).
- **Guaranteed structured output.** Hand it a JSON Schema and the output is
  *guaranteed* to conform — native guided generation built on Apple's
  `DynamicGenerationSchema`, not best-effort prompting. Stream it, too.
- **Long conversations stay coherent — and cheap.** `chat` holds one on-device
  session across turns, reusing the model's cache instead of replaying the
  transcript, and automatically summarizes older turns as the small context
  window fills. Press **Esc** to interrupt a reply mid-stream — the partial is kept.
- **The model can use tools — locally.** Opt `chat` into permission-gated `read`
  and `bash` tools (`--tools read,bash`) so the model can read a file or run a
  command to answer you. Every call is approved per-use, and it's all on your
  machine — still no network. Register your own `Tool` from the library, too.
- **Lightweight, nothing to audit.** Zero runtime dependencies — apple-fm just
  talks to the on-device model and gets out of your way.
- **Future-proof.** The helper resolves the current on-device model at runtime,
  so OS and model updates are picked up without a rebuild.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g apple-fm     # CLI
npm install apple-fm        # library
```

Requires macOS 26+ on Apple Silicon with Apple Intelligence enabled. Every
release is Developer-ID signed and notarized, so it runs without security
prompts.

### Platform support

apple-fm **installs on any OS** — so it can be a dependency of a cross-platform
project — but the on-device model only *runs* on **macOS 26+ Apple Silicon**.
Everywhere else it degrades gracefully instead of crashing: `probe()` returns
`{ available: false, reason: 'unsupportedPlatform' }`, and `generate` / `chat`
throw a clear `[unsupportedPlatform]` error. Gate on `isPlatformSupported()` or
`probe()`:

```ts
import { isPlatformSupported, probe, generate } from 'apple-fm';

if ((await probe()).available) {
  await generate({ prompt: '…' });
} else {
  // fall back (cloud model, cached result, skip the feature, …)
}
```

## CLI

```bash
apple-fm probe                       # is the on-device model available?
apple-fm generate "Summarize: …"     # one-shot text
cat notes.md | apple-fm generate     # read the prompt from stdin
apple-fm generate "…" --stream       # stream tokens as they arrive
apple-fm generate "…" --schema shape.json   # structured/guided JSON output
apple-fm chat                        # interactive chat (streamed, auto-compacted)
apple-fm chat --tools read,bash      # let the model read files / run commands (gated)
```

Run `apple-fm --help` for the full flag list.

### Check availability

Before generating, confirm Apple Intelligence is ready on this machine.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/demos/probe.svg" alt="apple-fm probe prints {&quot;available&quot;:true} when the on-device model is ready, or a reason like appleIntelligenceNotEnabled when it isn't." width="880">
</p>

### Structured output

Pass a JSON Schema with `--schema` and apple-fm returns JSON **guaranteed to
conform** to it — native guided generation, not prompt-and-hope — ready to pipe
into the rest of your tooling.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/demos/schema.svg" alt="apple-fm generate &quot;Recommend a classic sci-fi novel.&quot; --schema novel.json returns a JSON object with title, author, year, and why fields." width="880">
</p>

### Interactive chat

`chat` is a multi-turn REPL that streams replies and compacts the transcript
automatically near the context window. Built-in slash commands: `/reset`,
`/system`, `/clear`, `/compact`, `/help`, `/quit`. Press **Esc** while the model is
replying to interrupt it (the partial reply is kept in context).

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/demos/chat.svg" alt="apple-fm chat answers a prompt, then /help lists the slash commands (/reset, /system, /clear, /compact, /help, /quit) and notes that Esc interrupts a reply." width="880">
</p>

### Tool calling

Opt `chat` into built-in tools and the on-device model can call them mid-reply to
answer you — `read` (read a local file) and `bash` (run a shell command):

```bash
apple-fm chat --tools read,bash
```

Every call is **permission-gated**: you approve each one (`[y/N/a]`), or pre-approve
with `--allow-tool "bash:git "` / auto-approve with `--yes`; non-interactive runs
deny by default, so a script never silently runs a command. It stays **fully local** —
tools run on your machine and nothing hits the network. Library consumers can register
their own `Tool` (see [docs/9-tool-calling.md](docs/9-tool-calling.md)).

## Library

```ts
import { probe, generate, ChatSession } from 'apple-fm';

if ((await probe()).available) {
  // One-shot
  const summary = await generate({ prompt: 'Summarize: …', system: 'Be terse.' });

  // Streaming
  await generate({ prompt: '…', stream: true }, {}, (chunk) => process.stdout.write(chunk));

  // Guaranteed structured output — pass a JSON Schema, get conforming JSON back
  const json = await generate({ prompt: 'A classic sci-fi novel', schema: novelSchema });

  // Multi-turn chat: one persistent on-device session, auto-compacted
  const chat = new ChatSession({ system: 'You are a helpful assistant.' });
  const reply = await chat.send('Hello');
}
```

The full API (`probe`, `generate`, `ChatSession`, protocol helpers, and types) is
documented in [docs/ai/code-summary.md](docs/ai/code-summary.md).

## How it works

apple-fm talks to the same on-device model that powers Apple Intelligence —
nothing is sent to the cloud. For chat it keeps one model session alive across
turns so replies stay fast, and automatically summarizes older messages as the
context window fills, so long conversations stay coherent and cheap. And because
it resolves the current on-device model at runtime, OS and model updates are
picked up automatically — no reinstall.
